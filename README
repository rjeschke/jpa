-------------------------------------------------------

'jpa' is a Java wrapper for libPortAudio (v19), bringing this nice audio API
to us Java developers.

Usage:
------
* maven
    Have a look at http://renejeschke.de/maven. There you will find all information
    you need to use jpa with Java and Apache Maven.

Getting portaudio:
------------------
Linux:   Portaudio should be available for your dist using the standard ways 
         (e.g. apt-get).
Windows: As portaudio binaries are hard to get, I included a pre-compiled version
         supporting WME, DX and ASIO.
Mac:     Use homebrew. A 'brew install portaudio' should do the trick.
