jpa - portaudio Java bindings
----------------------------

'jpa' is a Java wrapper for libPortaudio, bringing this nice audio API
to us Java developers.

Currently Win32(64) and Linux32/64 binaries are included.

This is a WIP release (at least JavaDoc is missing, but you may have a look
at the portaudio19 docs).

Usage:
------
Just do an ant build and classpath the jpa.jar into your project.

Using Eclipse:
--------------
For Java:
  - create a new Java project in your workspace
  - Configure Build Path -> Sources -> Link Folders 'src/java' and 'lib' from
    the project folder
  - Remove the old 'src' folder inside the Eclipse project
For C:
  - Create a new C makefile project, override default location and use 'src/native'
    from the project folder

Build instructions:
-------------------
To build the Jar simply use 'ant'. You'll find 'jpa.jar'
inside of 'build/jar'.

To rebuild the binaries:
- On Linux 32 bit:
   (You will need to have the portaudio19 dev package installed)
   'ant linux32_clean' to clean the native target
   'ant linux32'
- On Linux 64 bit:
   (You will need to have the portaudio19 dev package installed)
   'ant linux64_clean' to clean the native target
   'ant linux64'
- On Windows 32 bit:
   (Includes all stuff needed to build)
   'ant win32_clean' to clean the native target
   'ant win32'
