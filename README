jpa - portaudio Java bindings
----------------------------

'jpa' is a Java wrapper for libPortaudio, bringing this nice audio API
to us Java developers.

Currently Win32(64) and Linux32/64 binaries are included.

This is a WIP release.

Build instructions:
-------------------
To build the Jar simply use 'ant'. You'll find 'jpa.jar'
inside of 'build/jar'.

To rebuild the binaries:
- On Linux 32 bit:
   'ant linux32_clean' to clean the native target
   'ant linux32'
- On Linux 64 bit:
   'ant linux64_clean' to clean the native target
   'ant linux64'
- On Windows 32 bit:
   'ant win32_clean' to clean the native target
   'ant win32'
