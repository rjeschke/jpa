jpa - PortAudio Java bindings
----------------------------

'jpa' is a Java wrapper for libPortAudio, bringing this nice audio API
to us Java developers.

Currently Win32(64) and Linux32/64 binaries are included.

Generated ApiDoc is mostly (slighty modified) copy'n'paste from the original
PortAudio docs.


Usage:
------
Just do 'ant release" and classpath the 'release/jpa.jar' into your project.
(I'll push the release folder unto github as soon as the ApiDoc is finished.)


Using Eclipse:
--------------
For Java:
  - create a new Java project in your workspace
  - Configure Build Path -> Sources -> Link Folders 'src/java' and 'lib' from
    the project folder
  - Remove the old 'src' folder inside the Eclipse project
  - Or use 'Create project from existing source'
For C:
  - Create a new C makefile project, override default location and use 'src/native'
    from the project folder
  - (Note to Windows users: Setting up the platform SDK or Visual Studio to build
    stuff on the command line is a bit tricky, I'll post a HOWTO in the near future.)


Build instructions:
-------------------
To build the Jar simply use 'ant'. You'll find 'jpa.jar' inside of 'build/jar'.
For a full release build, use 'ant release'. This will create the release jars
inside the 'release' folder (containing binary, apidoc and source).

To rebuild the binaries:
- On Linux 32 bit:
   (You will need to have the portaudio19 dev package installed)
   'ant linux32_clean' to clean the native target
   'ant linux32'
- On Linux 64 bit:
   (You will need to have the portaudio19 dev package installed)
   'ant linux64_clean' to clean the native target
   'ant linux64'
- On Windows 32 bit:
   (Includes all stuff needed to build)
   'ant win32_clean' to clean the native target
   'ant win32'
