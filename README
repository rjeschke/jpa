jpa - PortAudio Java bindings
Copyright (C) 2011 René Jeschke <rene_jeschke@yahoo.de>
See LICENSE.txt for licensing information.
-------------------------------------------------------

'jpa' is a Java wrapper for libPortAudio, bringing this nice audio API
to us Java developers.

Currently Win32, Linux32/64 and Mac universal binaries are included ... so
I'm covering the important systems I think.

Generated ApiDoc is mostly (slighty modified) copy'n'paste from the original
PortAudio docs (I did include an ApiDoc?).


Usage:
------
Just do 'ant release" and classpath the 'release/jpa.jar' into your project.
(I'll push the release folder unto github as soon as the ApiDoc is finished.)


Getting portaudio:
------------------
Linux:   Portaudio should be available for your dist using the standard ways 
         (e.g. apt-get).
Windows: As portaudio binaries are hard to get, I included a pre-compiled version
         supporting WME, DX, Jack and ASIO.
Mac:     Use homebrew. A 'brew install portaudio' should do the trick.


Using Eclipse:
--------------
For Java:
  - create a new Java project in your workspace
  - Configure Build Path -> Sources -> Link Folders 'src/java' and 'lib' from
    the project folder
  - Remove the old 'src' folder inside the Eclipse project
  - Or use 'Create project from existing source'
For C:
  - Create a new C makefile project, override default location and use 'src/native'
    from the project folder
  - (Note to Windows users: Setting up the platform SDK or Visual Studio to build
    stuff on the command line is a bit tricky, See the following link on how I did
    this using only free software: http://rjeschke.github.com/articles/article_1.html)


Build instructions:
-------------------
To build the Jar simply use 'ant'. You'll find 'jpa.jar' inside of 'build/jar'.
For a full release build, use 'ant release'. This will create the release jars
inside the 'release' folder (containing binary, apidoc and source).

To rebuild the binaries:
- On Linux 32 bit:
   (You will need to have the portaudio19 dev package installed)
   'ant linux32_clean' to clean the native target
   'ant linux32'
- On Linux 64 bit:
   (You will need to have the portaudio19 dev package installed)
   'ant linux64_clean' to clean the native target
   'ant linux64'
- On Windows 32 bit:
   (Includes all stuff needed to build)
   'ant win32_clean' to clean the native target
   'ant win32'
- On Mac OS:
   (homebrew: 'brew install portaudio --universal')
   'ant macos_clean' to clean the native target
   'ant macos' (builds i386/x86_64 universal binary
